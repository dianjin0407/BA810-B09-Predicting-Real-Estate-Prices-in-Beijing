## Executive Summary

The analysis aims at predicting real estate prices in Beijing with a systematic approach.

The data cleaning and transformation process, coupled with in-depth Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), revealed valuable patterns and relationships crucial for understanding the dynamic real estate market.

Leveraging scikit-learn pipelines facilitated efficient preprocessing. The predictive modeling stage encompassed various regression models, with a focus on fine-tuning high-performing ones. Ensemble methods, such as stacking and voting, were explored for their potential benefits, and validated through cross-validation.

Our project aims to tackle a significant real-world problem in the realm of real estate by predicting property prices based on historical sales data. We propose to develop a predictive model that can accurately estimate the total price of properties in Beijing, thus providing valuable insights for investors, buyers, and policy-makers.
